# PyBoxer

This project measures the speed and strength of punches over a 1 minute interval.
The apparatus consiting of 3 force sensors, an Arduino, a Raspberry pi and a small screen 
is to be strapped to a punching bag. The user then runs the program which opens a GUI with
a start button. Once the user presses the start button a 15 second countdown will begin 
so the user can put boxing gloves on. After the countdown a 60 second timer will begin and 
the user will punch the sensors as hard and fast as possible. Punch strength is displayed as 
each punch is landed and the number of punches is recorded. At the end of the 60 seconds
2 graphs appear to compare the users performance over time from the first performance to the 
current performance.
